Last Updated: 29th April 2024

Effective: 29th April 2024

## Introduction
**UserStars** does __not__, and will __never__, collect & store Messages, User Data, or Server Data without explicit notice & consent.
Additionally, **UserStars** will __never__ sell or give away the Data that it does store.

The developers of **UserStars** firmly believes in a "we don't want your data keep it away from us" process - thus, **UserStars** will be developed as "stateless" as possible (i.e: without needing to store any information or data at all). If features and functions are not possible to develop "stateless", we will explicitly include them in this **Privacy Policy**, covering exactly what is needed to be stored, and for what purpose..

**UserStars**'s source code is viewable in **UserStars**'s GitHub Repo ( https://github.com/TwilightZebby/UserStars ).

## Data Collection & Purposes
Below will be a list of what **UserStars** *does* store.

As a reminder: User IDs, Server IDs, Channel IDs, Message IDs, Role IDs, and Custom Emoji IDs are all publicly accessible from Discord's public API and official Clients/Apps.

- User IDs
  - *So **UserStars** can know how many Stars a User has received*

---

## Use of Locale Data
**UserStars** also makes use of the publicly available locale data (i.e: what language Users and Servers have set) Discord sends to all Bots/Apps using Discord's public API for "Interactions" (e.g: Slash Commands, Context Commands, Select Menus, Buttons, Modals). This locale data is only used for knowing which language **UserStars** should send its responses in, and is __NOT__ stored or tracked in any way.

You can see the public API Documentation regarding what the locale data includes on these official Discord API Documentation Pages:
- [API Locale Reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)
- [Locale field in Interaction Objects](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)
