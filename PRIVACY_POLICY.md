Last Updated: 22nd March 2024

Effective: 22nd March 2024

## Introduction
**StarCord** (henseforth "**The Bot**") does __not__, and will __never__, collect & store Messages, User Data, or Server Data without explicit notice & consent.
Additionally, **The Bot** will __never__ sell or give away the Data that it does store.

The developers of **The Bot** firmly believes in a "we don't want your data keep it away from us" process - thus, **The Bot** will be developed as "stateless" as possible (i.e: without needing to store any information or data at all). If features and functions are not possible to develop "stateless", we will explicitly include them in this **Privacy Policy**, covering exactly what is needed to be stored, and for what purpose..

**The Bot**'s source code is viewable in **The Bot**'s GitHub Repo ( https://github.com/TwilightZebby/StarCord ).

## Data Collection & Purposes
Below will be a list of what **The Bot** *does* store.

As a reminder: User IDs, Server IDs, Channel IDs, Message IDs, Role IDs, and Custom Emoji IDs are all publicly accessible from Discord's public API and official Clients/Apps.

- User IDs
  - *So the Bot can know how many Stars a User has received, and from whom*

---

## Use of Locale Data
**The Bot** also makes use of the publicly available locale data (i.e: what language Users and Servers have set) Discord sends to all Bots using Discord's public API for "Interactions" (e.g: Slash Commands, Context Commands, Select Menus, Buttons, Modals). This locale data is only used for knowing which language **The Bot** should send its responses in, and is __NOT__ stored or tracked in any way.

You can see the public API Documentation regarding what the locale data includes on these official Discord API Documentation Pages:
- [API Locale Reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)
- [Locale field in Interaction Objects](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)
