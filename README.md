# UserStars

A Starboard Bot for Users instead of Messages!

Give ⭐ Stars to Users all across Discord - in Servers, in Group DMs, and regular DMs; even if UserStars itself isn't in that space! All with the power of Discord's User App feature 👀

Plus, you can earn Rankings depending on how many Stars you have recieved from other Users - from Bronze to Silver to Gold, and so on.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> UserStars has been shut down, and is no longer able to be added to your account(s) as a User App. This is because it was mainly made to experiment with Discord's User Apps feature, and because it wasn't seeing much use, even from its developer!

## UserStars' Commands

### Giving and Revoking Stars
There are two ways you can give and/or revoke Stars for other Users.

Using Context Commands, you can:
- **[Desktop/Web]** Right-click a User's profile picture or name in chat > Select "Apps" > Select either "Give a Star" or "Revoke a Star"
- **[Mobile]** Tap a User's profile picture in chat > Scroll down to and select "Apps" > Select either "Give a Star" or "Revoke a Star"

Using Slash Commands *(on all platforms)*, you can use `/star` to either give or revoke a Star to the User you specify in the Command.


### Viewing your own Star Rank
You can view your own Star Rank by using the `/rank` Slash Command anywhere on Discord.


### Other UserStars Commands
UserStars also has two more Slash Commands:
- `/invite` for seeing the Invite Link to add UserStars as a User App
- `/support` for seeing the Server Invite for UserStars' Support Server - "Twilight Domain"
